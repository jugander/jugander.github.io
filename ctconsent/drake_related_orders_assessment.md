## User-provided links review

- `060612DrakePetroleumFinalDecisionpdf.pdf` is a DEEP Office of Adjudications **Final Decision**, not itself a consent order. It discusses a proposed consent order in an appeal matter (Order AOWSUST 11-001).

- `COWSUST13001.pdf` is a Drake Petroleum consent order in program Underground Storage Tank (date 2014-03-31 in CT Open Data).

## Relation to missing 2009 site-remediation row

- The missing row in the subset is dated 2009-08-18, program `Site Remediation`, town `Mansfield`, and has no public PDF URL in dataset metadata.
- `COAR2200` (Air) and `COWSUST13001` (UST) appear to be separate enforcement matters.
- The 2012 final decision is an adjudication document and appears separate from the 2009 Mansfield site-remediation summary.
